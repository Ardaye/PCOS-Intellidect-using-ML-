This project investigates various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. By utilizing structured patient data—such as clinical symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging results—the goal is to identify disease indicators at earlier stages, improving early diagnosis.
